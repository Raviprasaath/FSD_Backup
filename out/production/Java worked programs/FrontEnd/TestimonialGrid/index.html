                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
